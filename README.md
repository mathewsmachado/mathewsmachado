## Welcome to my GitHub page 🤠

Here is where I can validate ideas and experiment new things without being afraid of being wrong. It's important to say that I have few projects here and this is because, in the early years of a software developer's life, works get old quickly. The growth process is so intense that a project that has been made some weeks or months ago does not represent one's knowlodge level anymore.

Talking about tech stuff (👨🏻‍💻), I work on a Linux environment, more precisely, a [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) one. In the past I have learned to programm in C and, in the future, I would like to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Despite knowing that 99% of web softwares can be made with any popular language, because of its versatility, I have chosen the JavaScript ecosystem to work with. That includes its most famous tools, like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), etc.

You're gonna find me thinking, reading, studying, seeking the truth and, moreover, on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathewsmachado/) and my email, mathews.machadoamorim@gmail.com.

See ya :)
